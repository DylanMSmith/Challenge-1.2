# Code Refactor Starter Code
For my code I started with the "Semantic Elements" and changed most of the <div> markings to better organize the code and easier for the viewer to read. I then made sure the structure of the code flowed along with the webpage, and things like text and color were consistant throughout the webpage. Next the Acceptance Criteria asked for "alt:" attributes, so I put in "alt:" attributes for the images on the in html and css. To put in a concise title I coded in "Horiseon" into Line 6 of html.
